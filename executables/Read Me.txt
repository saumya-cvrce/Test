- Download the executables folder to the local system.
- The applications can be executed by double clicking the "Startscript.bat" file located inside executables folder location.

- The application can be accessed by logging into the below url
  http://localhost:7070

  User Input:
   Please provide the customer ID as it is required field for both Create account and Get account info.
   
   Note- One pre configured customer is available at the moment "customer123" as per the requirement.
    
    The above id shall be used to create any new account or get the transactions.


Troubleshooting:
----------------- 
The account service is running in 7070 port
The transaction service is running in 7071 port

In case of a port clash please verify if the port(7070/7071) is already in use by following the below command and if it can be killed as dynamic configuration of port is missing current implementation of scripts.
 
netstat -ano | findstr :<Port>
taskkill /PID <process ID> /F
